#Arduino self driving car using HY-SRF05 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module

##This project uses an arduino uno, an L293D motor driver, an HY-SRF05 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module, a 5g small servo, two DAGU DG01D 48:1 dc geared motors, two battery holders for 3 batteries each, 6 1.2V rechargeable batteries totalling 7.2V for the motors and one 9V E battery to power the arduino as well as wires for the connections. 

##This project uses the arduino servo library (Servo.h) to control the servo and the newping library (NewPing.h) to control and improve the accuracy of the distance sensor measurments. ***Note that the NewPing library has to be installed by the user, it is not a standard arduino library.***
